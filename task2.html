    <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>

     
    <p>William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon.
       His birthday is most commonly celebrated<BR> on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born),
        which is also believed to be the date he died in 1616.<BR>
        Shakespeare was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre 
        (sometimes called the English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period).<BR> 
       Shakespeare's plays are perhaps his most enduring legacy, but they are not all he wrote. Shakespeare’s poems also remain popular to this day. </p>
   
      <h2>H.C Andersen</h2>  

      <p>Hans Christian Andersen was a product of two towns, two social environments, two worlds and two ages. 
        Both as a man and as a writer he thus continually developed and changed,<BR> 
        but was also in constant dialogue with himself and even at times at war with himself. 
        Thus his social rise provides the direct and indirect motif in many of his tales, novels and plays,<BR> 
        both as a productive source in his search for a new and more comprehensive identity and as a source of perpetual and unresolved traumas.</p>    


        <h3>Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

        <p>Edgar Allan Poe, (born Jan. 19, 1809, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died Oct. 7, 1849, Baltimore, Md.), 
            U.S. poet, critic, and short-story writer. Poe was raised by foster parents in Richmond, Va.,<BR> 
            following his mother’s death in 1811. He briefly attended the University of Virginia and then returned 
            to Boston, where in 1827 he published a pamphlet of youthful, Byronic poems. By 1835 he was in Richmond <BR>
            as editor of the Southern Literary Messenger, the first of several periodicals he was to edit or write for. 
            There he married a 13-year-old cousin, who died in 1847. At various times he lived in Baltimore, New York, <BR>
            and Philadelphia. Alcohol, the bane of his irregular and eccentric life, caused his death at age 40. 
            His works are famous for his cultivation of mystery and the macabre. Among his tales are “The Fall of the House of Usher,”<BR>
            “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Black Cat,” “The Tell-Tale Heart,” and “The Pit and the Pendulum.” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” 
            and “The Purloined Letter” initiated the modern detective story.<BR> His poems (less highly regarded now than formerly) are musical and sensuous,
            as in “The Bells,” a showcase of sound effects; they include touching lyrics inspired by women (e.g., “Annabel Lee”) and the uncanny (e.g., “The Raven”).</p>
